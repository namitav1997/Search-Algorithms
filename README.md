# Search-Algorithms
<b>Implementation of essential search algorithms in Java.</b>
* <b>Linear Search</b> - In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.
* <b>Binary Search</b> - Binary search is a fast search algorithm with run-time complexity of ÎŸ(log n). This search algorithm works on the principle of divide and conquer.
Binary search looks for a particular item by comparing the middle most item of the collection. If a match occurs, then the index of item is returned. If the middle item is greater than the item, then the item is searched in the sub-array to the left of the middle item. Otherwise, the item is searched for in the sub-array to the right of the middle item. This process continues on the sub-array as well until the size of the sub-array reduces to zero.
